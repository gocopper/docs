# Intro to Copper

Copper is a Go toolkit complete with everything you need to build web apps. It focuses on developer productivity, makes building web apps in Go more fun with less boilerplate, and provides out-of-the-box support for common needs. Most importantly, it stays out of your way and relies on the Go standard library as much as possible to keep your code idiomatic Go.
